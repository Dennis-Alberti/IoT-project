#                                                        Spy Rover
Here we can put whatever we make.

We are gonna put here also all the details of the project, to reference check the projects of the previous years, like this one: https://github.com/Clown-Machine/ClawMachine?tab=readme-ov-file


So we have to say a lot of things also about how to vreate and build the project.

==========================================================================

This project tries to create and learn how a exploration rover can be, how can be built and what we can do whit it. We liked the idea to do something that could move everywhere, on every type of soil and very far away, so we projected and created our personal rover from from scratch.

Because we couldn't see it everywhere, we gave to the rover an eye (a camera), so we can see what he sees.

Maybe is not a professional rover, or a competitive one, but for sure we learned from 0 a lot of useful things.

## Requirements

To build and use this project, you need the following hardware:

- 1x Texas Instruments MSP432P401R microcontroller
