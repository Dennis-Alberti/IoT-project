#                                                        Spy Rover
Here we can put whatever we make.

We are gonna put here also all the details of the project, to reference check the projects of the previous years, like this one: https://github.com/Clown-Machine/ClawMachine?tab=readme-ov-file


So we have to say a lot of things also about how to vreate and build the project.

==========================================================================

This project tries to create and learn how a exploration rover can be, how can be built and what we can do with it. We liked the idea to do something that could move everywhere, on every type of soil and very far away, so we projected and created our personal rover from scratch.

Because we couldn't see it everywhere, we gave to the rover an eye (a camera), so we can see what it sees.

Maybe is not a professional rover, or a competitive one, but for sure with a very limited budget and almost 0 knowledge, we made something very nice and learned a lot of useful things.

## Requirements

To build and use this project, you need the following hardware:

- 1x Texas Instruments MSP432P401R microcontroller
- 1x [Educational BoosterPack MKII](https://www.ti.com/tool/BOOSTXL-EDUMKII)
- 2x [Esp32-Wroom-32D](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32d_esp32-wroom-32u_datasheet_en.pdf)
- 1x [Esp32-CAM](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/DFRobot%20PDFs/DFR0602_Web.pdf)
- 4x DC Motors
- 2x L298N motor's driver
- 2x micro servomotor
- A 12 volt 1.5 Amp powersource (for the motor controller board)
- 2x 5 volt powersource (1 for the Esp-Cam, 1 for the Servomotors)
  - If you want, you can use a voltage step down board (we did this due to time and budget costrains)
- 2x rover track outer frame
- 2x rover track inner frame
- 2x full rover tracks
- 6x cog
- Rover base frame
- 2x L298N driver holder
- Rover floor frame
- Base for camera structure
- Pan & tilt arm base
- Pan part for "turret"
- Tilt part for "turret"
- Esp32-Cam holder
- Jumper wires of all types (M/F , M/M , F/F)
- A lot of screws and bolts
- 1 Usb-C cable for the Esp32-Cam
